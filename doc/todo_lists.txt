ABOUT                                                         *TodoListsAbout*

The plugin provides a number of different commands for CRUD operations on
your markdown todo lists. The main benefit of using the plugin is that it 
automatically ‘propagates’ changes to the relevant child/parent todos i.e. 
checking the last child todo will check the parent, deleting a todo will
delete all the nested todos, etc.

USAGE                                                         *TodoListsUsage*

:TodoListsCheckTodo                  Checks the current todo and all its nested
                                     todos. This will also check the parent
                                     (and potentially further ancestors) if it
                                     was the last unchecked child.

:TodoListsUncheckTodo                Unchecks the current todo and all its
                                     nested todos. This will also uncheck all
                                     ancestor todos.

:TodoListsToggleTodo                 Checks an unchecked todo, unchecks a
                                     checked one.

:TodoListsInsertSiblingTodo          Inserts a todo at the same level of
                                     indentation as the current todo.
                                     The todo is inserted after all nested
                                     todos of the current todo. This
                                     will uncheck the parent of the current
                                     todo if it was previously checked.
                              

:TodoListsInsertChildTodo            Inserts a nested todo directly after the
                                     currently selected todo. This will uncheck
                                     the currently selected todo if previously
                                     is was checked.

:TodoListsDeleteTodo                 Deletes the current todo along with all
                                     its nested todos (children,
                                     grandchildren, etc...). This will check
                                     the parent todo if it was the last
                                     unchecked child.
