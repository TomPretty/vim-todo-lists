Given markdown (A todo):
  - [ ] one
  - [ ] two

Do (Delete the todo):
  :TodoListsDeleteTodo\<cr>

Then (The todo has been deleted):
  Assert match(getline(1), 'two') > -1


Given markdown (A todo with children):
  - [ ] one
    - [ ] one a
      - [ ] one a i
  - [ ] two

Do (Delete the todo):
  :TodoListsDeleteTodo\<cr>

Then (All nested todos have been deleted):
  Assert match(getline(1), 'two') > -1


Given markdown (A todo with one unchecked child):
  - [ ] one
    - [x] one a
    - [ ] one b

Do (Delete the last unchecked child):
  2j
  :TodoListsDeleteTodo\<cr>

Then (The parent is now checked):
  Assert match(getline(1), 'x') > -1
